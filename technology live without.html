<h4>Imagine a world without GUI. Every OS would use DOS. </h4> 
<p>I can only imagine how much time would be lost without point and click tehcnology. 
A monumental amount of people would be incapable of using computers since GUI has made computer usage easy enough for 4 year olds to figure out.
Old people thinking about getting a computer would be just about extinct, and successfully using the latest windows operating system would be difficult and a tad impressive.
Searching for something on a computer would take an extensive amount of time as there is no search bar. 
If you wanted to find something you had to enter dir and it would list everything in the current directory and you could select a directory to go to from there; you had to continue to scour the directories like this until you found what you were looking for.
