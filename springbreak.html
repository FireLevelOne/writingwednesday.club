<p>What I know for sure I'll be doing is working at Stevi B's, my place of employment. 
Possibly more than usual because other people are taking off, I doubt it though my general manager understanding that workers have lives and don't want to spend their entirety at work.</p>
<p>Usually I go to Panama City Beach but I wont be doing that this year.
